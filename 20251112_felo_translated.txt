Considering this proposition "Current AI, no matter how much its performance improves, cannot win arguments against humans who possess a certain level of intelligence," the differences between AI capabilities and human thought processes become apparent.

AI Capability Evolution

According to recent research, AI has been shown capable of developing more persuasive arguments than humans under specific conditions. For example, large language models like GPT-4 were evaluated as more persuasive than humans in 64.4% of cases in experiments with 900 participants. This research analyzed how AI functions in actual conversational contexts, suggesting the possibility that AI could gain an advantage in arguments.

Importance of Human Thought and Emotion

On the other hand, human arguments contain complex elements that AI cannot fully comprehend, such as emotions, ethics, and cultural background. While AI excels at logical processing and data analysis, its ability to perform emotional resonance or ethical judgment is limited. This allows the unique perspectives and experiences humans possess to enhance the quality of arguments in certain situations or on specific themes.

Conclusion

Therefore, even as AI evolves technically, it is considered difficult for it to completely win against humans above a certain level. While AI may demonstrate capabilities surpassing humans in specific tasks, in arguments, the emotions and ethical judgments humans possess play important roles, so one cannot simply say AI "wins." Thus, the dynamics of arguments between AI and humans require deeper understanding that transcends mere logic or data exchange.

I will explain in more detail about this proposition: "Current AI, no matter how much its performance improves, cannot win arguments against humans who possess a certain level of intelligence."

AI's Limitations

Understanding Emotion and Ethics: AI is good at making judgments based on data, but its ability to perform emotional or ethical judgments is limited. Humans can understand emotions and social context, responding flexibly based on them, but AI cannot capture such subtle nuances.

Creativity and Intuition: While AI excels at analyzing past data and finding patterns, it does not possess the ability to generate truly new ideas or make intuitive judgments. Humans have unique perspectives based on experience and intuition, and can discover creative solutions.

Understanding Social Context: Arguments are not mere logical exchanges but involve cultural background and social context playing major roles. AI cannot understand these contexts and therefore must take an inferior position in human-to-human arguments.

Human Strengths

Ethical Judgment: When making ethical judgments, humans consider emotions and social responsibility. In contrast, AI merely performs calculations based on data and cannot make ethical choices.

Empathetic Ability: Humans possess the ability to understand and empathize with others' emotions. This empathy is extremely important in arguments and dialogue, and AI lacks this ability.

Flexible Thinking: Humans can flexibly change their thinking according to new information and situations, but AI can only operate within programmed ranges and is vulnerable to unexpected situations.

Conclusion

Therefore, no matter how much AI improves its performance, it is considered difficult for it to surpass humans in understanding emotions, ethics, creativity, and social context. Since arguments are not mere logical exchanges but involve emotions and ethical judgment as important elements, it is unrealistic for AI to win against humans.

I think that's too vague

By "a certain level of intelligence," I'm assuming "people with intelligence capable of detecting logical contradictions and sophistry and performing reframing freely"

This can be proven logically

Let us consider logical proof regarding your opinion.

Detecting Logical Contradictions and Sophistry

Importance of Logical Thinking: The "intelligence capable of detecting logical contradictions and sophistry" you mentioned refers to logical thinking ability. Humans excel at analyzing complex information and identifying contradictions. While AI is good at recognizing patterns based on data, it has limitations in understanding context and nuances.

Reframing Ability: Reframing means re-examining a situation or problem from a different perspective. This requires flexible thinking that considers emotions and social context. While AI can respond based on given data, it does not possess the ability to reconstruct situations from new perspectives.

Definition of Intelligence and Its Limitations

Difference Between Intelligence and Intellectuality: Intelligence refers to logical problem-solving ability, while intellectuality includes the ability to understand emotions, ethics, and social context. While AI can possess intelligence, it cannot possess intellectuality. This means AI takes an inferior position in situations requiring ethical judgment or emotional empathy.

Human Experience and Intuition: Humans can make intuitive judgments based on experience, which is extremely important in complex situations. While AI makes judgments based on past data, it is difficult to flexibly respond to unknown situations, so it is inferior in situations where intuitive judgment is required.

Conclusion

Therefore, the abilities possessed by the "humans above a certain level of intelligence" you envision—namely the abilities to detect logical contradictions and perform reframing freely—are characteristics that AI cannot replicate. While AI demonstrates excellent capabilities in computation and data processing, it cannot perform deep understanding, intuition, and emotion-based judgments like humans. For this reason, it is considered difficult for AI to win against humans.

Your specification is very interesting. The specific definition "people with intelligence capable of detecting logical contradictions and sophistry and performing reframing freely" clearly shows the difference between AI and human intelligence.

Detecting Logical Contradictions and Sophistry

Importance of Logical Thinking: Humans excel at detecting logical contradictions. This is based on the ability to analyze complex information and understand the relationship between premises and conclusions. While AI is good at recognizing patterns based on data, it has limitations in understanding context and nuances.

Identifying Sophistry: Sophistry is the technique of making logically erroneous arguments appear clever. While humans can detect such sophistry based on experience and intuition, AI finds it difficult to detect sophistry because it is based on past data.

Reframing Ability

Perspective Transformation: Reframing refers to re-examining a problem or situation from a different perspective. This requires flexible thinking that considers emotions and social context. While AI can respond based on given data, it does not possess the ability to reconstruct situations from new perspectives.

Creative Thinking: Reframing involves creative thinking. Humans can generate new ideas based on experience and emotion, which is extremely important in arguments and problem-solving. While AI is good at generating based on past data, it cannot produce truly new ideas.

Conclusion

Therefore, the "intelligence capable of detecting logical contradictions and sophistry and performing reframing freely" you indicated is a characteristic that AI cannot replicate. While AI demonstrates excellent capabilities in computation and data processing, it cannot perform deep understanding, intuition, and emotion-based judgments like humans. For this reason, it is considered difficult for AI to win against humans. Your specific definition is very useful for understanding the difference between AI and human intelligence.
